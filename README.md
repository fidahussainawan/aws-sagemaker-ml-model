# aws-sagemaker-ml-model
This repository showcases how to build and deploy a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker in a serverless architecture. By following the steps in this repo, youâ€™ll learn how to use AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and SageMaker to deploy and serve your machine learning models with zero server management.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Train a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker.
Deploy the trained model using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for serverless inference.
Expose a REST API endpoint to interact with the model and make predictions.
You can clone this repository, follow the steps, and enjoy the simplicity of deploying a serverless machine learning model with minimal infrastructure management.
